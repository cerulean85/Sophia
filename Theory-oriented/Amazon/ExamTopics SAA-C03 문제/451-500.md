A company has multiple AWS accounts for development work. Some staff consistently use oversized Amazon EC2 instances, which causes the company to exceed the yearly budget for the development accounts. The company wants to centrally restrict the creation of AWS resources in these accounts.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort?

A. Develop AWS Systems Manager templates that use an approved EC2 creation process. Use the approved Systems Manager templates to provision EC2 instances.
B. Use AWS Organizations to organize the accounts into organizational units (OUs). Define and attach a service control policy (SCP) to control the usage of EC2 instance types.
C. Configure an Amazon EventBridge rule that invokes an AWS Lambda function when an EC2 instance is created. Stop disallowed EC2 instance types.
D. Set up AWS Service Catalog products for the staff to create the allowed EC2 instance types. Ensure that staff can deploy EC2 instances only by using the Service Catalog products.

A company uses Amazon EC2 instances to host its internal systems. As part of a deployment operation, an administrator tries to use the AWS CLI to terminate an EC2 instance. However, the administrator receives a 403 (Access Denied) error message.

![alt text](image-2.png)

The administrator is using an IAM role that has the following IAM policy attached:
What is the cause of the unsuccessful request?

B. The principal has not been specified in the policy statement.
C. The "Action" field does not grant the actions that are required to terminate the EC2 instance.
D. The request to terminate the EC2 instance does not originate from the CIDR blocks 192.0.2.0/24 or 203.0.113.0/24.

A company uses on-premises servers to host its applications. The company is running out of storage capacity. The applications use both block storage and NFS storage. The company needs a high-performing solution that supports local caching without re-architecting its existing applications.

Which combination of actions should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Mount Amazon S3 as a file system to the on-premises servers.
B. Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway to replace NFS storage.
C. Deploy AWS Snowball Edge to provision NFS mounts to on-premises servers.
D. Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway to replace the block storage.
E. Deploy Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volumes and mount them to on-premises servers.

A company has a service that reads and writes large amounts of data from an Amazon S3 bucket in the same AWS Region. The service is deployed on Amazon EC2 instances within the private subnet of a VPC. The service communicates with Amazon S3 over a NAT gateway in the public subnet. However, the company wants a solution that will reduce the data output costs.

Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Provision a dedicated EC2 NAT instance in the public subnet. Configure the route table for the private subnet to use the elastic network interface of this instance as the destination for all S3 traffic.
B. Provision a dedicated EC2 NAT instance in the private subnet. Configure the route table for the public subnet to use the elastic network interface of this instance as the destination for all S3 traffic.
C. Provision a VPC gateway endpoint. Configure the route table for the private subnet to use the gateway endpoint as the route for all S3 traffic.
D. Provision a second NAT gateway. Configure the route table for the private subnet to use this NAT gateway as the destination for all S3 traffic.
