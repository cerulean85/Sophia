A company uses AWS Organizations with a single OU named Production to manage multiple accounts. All accounts are members of the Production OU. Administrators use deny list SCPs in the root of the organization to manage access to restricted services.
The company recently acquired a new business unit and invited the new unit’s existing AWS account to the organization. Once onboarded, the administrators of the new business unit discovered that they are not able to update existing AWS Config rules to meet the company’s policies.
Which option will allow administrators to make changes and continue to enforce the current policies without introducing additional long-term maintenance?

A. Remove the organization’s root SCPs that limit access to AWS Config. Create AWS Service Catalog products for the company’s standard AWS Config rules and deploy them throughout the organization, including the new account.
B. Create a temporary OU named Onboarding for the new account. Apply an SCP to the Onboarding OU to allow AWS Config actions. Move the new account to the Production OU when adjustments to AWS Config are complete.
C. Convert the organization’s root SCPs from deny list SCPs to allow list SCPs to allow the required services only. Temporarily apply an SCP to the organization’s root that allows AWS Config actions for principals only in the new account.
D. Create a temporary OU named Onboarding for the new account. Apply an SCP to the Onboarding OU to allow AWS Config actions. Move the organization’s root SCP to the Production OU. Move the new account to the Production OU when adjustments to AWS Config are complete.

A company uses a service to collect metadata from applications that the company hosts on premises. Consumer devices such as TVs and internet radios access the applications. Many older devices do not support certain HTTP headers and exhibit errors when these headers are present in responses. The company has configured an on-premises load balancer to remove the unsupported headers from responses sent to older devices, which the company identified by the User-Agent headers.
The company wants to migrate the service to AWS, adopt serverless technologies, and retain the ability to support the older devices. The company has already migrated the applications into a set of AWS Lambda functions.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution for the metadata service. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Configure the CloudFront distribution to forward requests to the ALB. Configure the ALB to invoke the correct Lambda function for each type of request. Create a CloudFront function to remove the problematic headers based on the value of the User-Agent header.
B. Create an Amazon API Gateway REST API for the metadata service. Configure API Gateway to invoke the correct Lambda function for each type of request. Modify the default gateway responses to remove the problematic headers based on the value of the User-Agent header.
C. Create an Amazon API Gateway HTTP API for the metadata service. Configure API Gateway to invoke the correct Lambda function for each type of request. Create a response mapping template to remove the problematic headers based on the value of the User-Agent. Associate the response data mapping with the HTTP API.
D. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution for the metadata service. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Configure the CloudFront distribution to forward requests to the ALB. Configure the ALB to invoke the correct Lambda function for each type of request. Create a Lambda@Edge function that will remove the problematic headers in response to viewer requests based on the value of the User-Agent header.

A company is running a traditional web application on Amazon EC2 instances. The company needs to refactor the application as microservices that run on containers. Separate versions of the application exist in two distinct environments: production and testing. Load for the application is variable, but the minimum load and the maximum load are known. A solutions architect needs to design the updated application with a serverless architecture that minimizes operational complexity.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Upload the container images to AWS Lambda as functions. Configure a concurrency limit for the associated Lambda functions to handle the expected peak load. Configure two separate Lambda integrations within Amazon API Gateway: one for production and one for testing.
B. Upload the container images to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR). Configure two auto scaled Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) clusters with the Fargate launch type to handle the expected load. Deploy tasks from the ECR images. Configure two separate Application Load Balancers to direct traffic to the ECS clusters.
C. Upload the container images to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR). Configure two auto scaled Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) clusters with the Fargate launch type to handle the expected load. Deploy tasks from the ECR images. Configure two separate Application Load Balancers to direct traffic to the EKS clusters.
D. Upload the container images to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. In Elastic Beanstalk, create separate environments and deployments for production and testing. Configure two separate Application Load Balancers to direct traffic to the Elastic Beanstalk deployments.

A company has a multi-tier web application that runs on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The instances are in an Auto Scaling group. The ALB and the Auto Scaling group are replicated in a backup AWS Region. The minimum value and the maximum value for the Auto Scaling group are set to zero. An Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB instance stores the application’s data. The DB instance has a read replica in the backup Region. The application presents an endpoint to end users by using an Amazon Route 53 record.
The company needs to reduce its RTO to less than 15 minutes by giving the application the ability to automatically fail over to the backup Region. The company does not have a large enough budget for an active-active strategy.
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?

A. Reconfigure the application’s Route 53 record with a latency-based routing policy that load balances traffic between the two ALBs. Create an AWS Lambda function in the backup Region to promote the read replica and modify the Auto Scaling group values. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that is based on the HTTPCode_Target_5XX_Count metric for the ALB in the primary Region. Configure the CloudWatch alarm to invoke the Lambda function.
B. Create an AWS Lambda function in the backup Region to promote the read replica and modify the Auto Scaling group values. Configure Route 53 with a health check that monitors the web application and sends an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification to the Lambda function when the health check status is unhealthy. Update the application’s Route 53 record with a failover policy that routes traffic to the ALB in the backup Region when a health check failure occurs.
C. Configure the Auto Scaling group in the backup Region to have the same values as the Auto Scaling group in the primary Region. Reconfigure the application’s Route 53 record with a latency-based routing policy that load balances traffic between the two ALBs. Remove the read replica. Replace the read replica with a standalone RDS DB instance. Configure Cross-Region Replication between the RDS DB instances by using snapshots and Amazon S3.
D. Configure an endpoint in AWS Global Accelerator with the two ALBs as equal weighted targets. Create an AWS Lambda function in the backup Region to promote the read replica and modify the Auto Scaling group values. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that is based on the HTTPCode_Target_5XX_Count metric for the ALB in the primary Region. Configure the CloudWatch alarm to invoke the Lambda function.

A company is hosting a critical application on a single Amazon EC2 instance. The application uses an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis single-node cluster for an in-memory data store. The application uses an Amazon RDS for MariaDB DB instance for a relational database. For the application to function, each piece of the infrastructure must be healthy and must be in an active state.
A solutions architect needs to improve the application's architecture so that the infrastructure can automatically recover from failure with the least possible downtime.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose three.)

A. Use an Elastic Load Balancer to distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances. Ensure that the EC2 instances are part of an Auto Scaling group that has a minimum capacity of two instances.
B. Use an Elastic Load Balancer to distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances. Ensure that the EC2 instances are configured in unlimited mode.
C. Modify the DB instance to create a read replica in the same Availability Zone. Promote the read replica to be the primary DB instance in failure scenarios.
D. Modify the DB instance to create a Multi-AZ deployment that extends across two Availability Zones.
E. Create a replication group for the ElastiCache for Redis cluster. Configure the cluster to use an Auto Scaling group that has a minimum capacity of two instances.
F. Create a replication group for the ElastiCache for Redis cluster. Enable Multi-AZ on the cluster.

A retail company is operating its ecommerce application on AWS. The application runs on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The company uses an Amazon RDS DB instance as the database backend. Amazon CloudFront is configured with one origin that points to the ALB. Static content is cached. Amazon Route 53 is used to host all public zones.
After an update of the application, the ALB occasionally returns a 502 status code (Bad Gateway) error. The root cause is malformed HTTP headers that are returned to the ALB. The webpage returns successfully when a solutions architect reloads the webpage immediately after the error occurs.
While the company is working on the problem, the solutions architect needs to provide a custom error page instead of the standard ALB error page to visitors.
Which combination of steps will meet this requirement with the LEAST amount of operational overhead? (Choose two.)

A. Create an Amazon S3 bucket. Configure the S3 bucket to host a static webpage. Upload the custom error pages to Amazon S3.
B. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to invoke an AWS Lambda function if the ALB health check response Target.FailedHealthChecks is greater than 0. Configure the Lambda function to modify the forwarding rule at the ALB to point to a publicly accessible web server.
C. Modify the existing Amazon Route 53 records by adding health checks. Configure a fallback target if the health check fails. Modify DNS records to point to a publicly accessible webpage.
D. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to invoke an AWS Lambda function if the ALB health check response Elb.InternalError is greater than 0. Configure the Lambda function to modify the forwarding rule at the ALB to point to a public accessible web server.
E. Add a custom error response by configuring a CloudFront custom error page. Modify DNS records to point to a publicly accessible web page.
