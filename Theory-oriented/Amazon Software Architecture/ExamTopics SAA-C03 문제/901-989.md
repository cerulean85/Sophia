A company is migrating its workloads to AWS. The company has sensitive and critical data in on-premises relational databases that run on SQL Server instances.

The company wants to use the AWS Cloud to increase security and reduce operational overhead for the databases.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Migrate the databases to Amazon EC2 instances. Use an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) AWS managed key for encryption.
B. Migrate the databases to a Multi-AZ Amazon RDS for SQL Server DB instance. Use an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) AWS managed key for encryption.
C. Migrate the data to an Amazon S3 bucket. Use Amazon Macie to ensure data security.
D. Migrate the databases to an Amazon DynamoDB table. Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to ensure data security.

A company wants to migrate an application to AWS. The company wants to increase the application's current availability. The company wants to use AWS WAF in the application's architecture.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Create an Auto Scaling group that contains multiple Amazon EC2 instances that host the application across two Availability Zones. Configure an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and set the Auto Scaling group as the target. Connect a WAF to the ALB.
B. Create a cluster placement group that contains multiple Amazon EC2 instances that hosts the application. Configure an Application Load Balancer and set the EC2 instances as the targets. Connect a WAF to the placement group.
C. Create two Amazon EC2 instances that host the application across two Availability Zones. Configure the EC2 instances as the targets of an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Connect a WAF to the ALB.
D. Create an Auto Scaling group that contains multiple Amazon EC2 instances that host the application across two Availability Zones. Configure an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and set the Auto Scaling group as the target. Connect a WAF to the Auto Scaling group.

A company manages a data lake in an Amazon S3 bucket that numerous applications access. The S3 bucket contains a unique prefix for each application. The company wants to restrict each application to its specific prefix and to have granular control of the objects under each prefix.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Create dedicated S3 access points and access point policies for each application.
B. Create an S3 Batch Operations job to set the ACL permissions for each object in the S3 bucket.
C. Replicate the objects in the S3 bucket to new S3 buckets for each application. Create replication rules by prefix.
D. Replicate the objects in the S3 bucket to new S3 buckets for each application. Create dedicated S3 access points for each application.

# 904
A company has an application that customers use to upload images to an Amazon S3 bucket. Each night, the company launches an Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet that processes all the images that the company received that day. The processing for each image takes 2 minutes and requires 512 MB of memory.

A solutions architect needs to change the application to process the images when the images are uploaded.

Which change will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Use S3 Event Notifications to write a message with image details to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure an AWS Lambda function to read the messages from the queue and to process the images.

B. Use S3 Event Notifications to write a message with image details to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure an EC2 Reserved Instance to read the messages from the queue and to process the images.

C. Use S3 Event Notifications to publish a message with image details to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Configure a container instance in Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) to subscribe to the topic and to process the images.

D. Use S3 Event Notifications to publish a message with image details to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Configure an AWS Elastic Beanstalk application to subscribe to the topic and to process the images.

# 905
A company wants to improve the availability and performance of its hybrid application. The application consists of a stateful TCP-based workload hosted on Amazon EC2 instances in different AWS Regions and a stateless UDP-based workload hosted on premises.

Which combination of actions should a solutions architect take to improve availability and performance? (Choose two.)

A. Create an accelerator using AWS Global Accelerator. Add the load balancers as endpoints.
B. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an origin that uses Amazon Route 53 latency-based routing to route requests to the load balancers.
C. Configure two Application Load Balancers in each Region. The first will route to the EC2 endpoints, and the second will route to the on-premises endpoints.
D. Configure a Network Load Balancer in each Region to address the EC2 endpoints. Configure a Network Load Balancer in each Region that routes to the on-premises endpoints.
E. Configure a Network Load Balancer in each Region to address the EC2 endpoints. Configure an Application Load Balancer in each Region that routes to the on-premises endpoints.

# 906
A company runs a self-managed Microsoft SQL Server on Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS). Daily snapshots are taken of the EBS volumes.

Recently, all the companyâ€™s EBS snapshots were accidentally deleted while running a snapshot cleaning script that deletes all expired EBS snapshots. A solutions architect needs to update the architecture to prevent data loss without retaining EBS snapshots indefinitely.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort?

A. Change the IAM policy of the user to deny EBS snapshot deletion.
B. Copy the EBS snapshots to another AWS Region after completing the snapshots daily.
C. Create a 7-day EBS snapshot retention rule in Recycle Bin and apply the rule for all snapshots.
D. Copy EBS snapshots to Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA).
